# 🚀 Next.js to Flutter Code Converter

## 📝 Project Scope

### 🔹 Objective  
Create an automated system that converts **Next.js frontend code (TSX/JSX)** into **Flutter Dart code**, allowing seamless migration from web to mobile.

### 🔹 Goals  
✅ Convert **Next.js JSX Components** into **Flutter Widgets**  
✅ Convert **CSS styles (Tailwind, CSS Modules, Styled Components)** into Flutter ThemeData  
✅ Convert **React State (`useState`, `useEffect`)** into Flutter Stateful Widgets  
✅ Convert **Event Handlers (`onClick`, `onChange`)** into Flutter equivalents  
✅ Support **API Calls (fetch, axios) → Flutter http package**  
✅ Provide a **web-based UI** to allow users to **upload Next.js code and receive Flutter files**  

### 🔹 Non-Goals (Not in Scope for v1.0)  
❌ Server-side rendering (Next.js SSR)  
❌ Automatic Next.js API conversion into a Flutter backend  
❌ Full application conversion (Focus only on UI for now)
